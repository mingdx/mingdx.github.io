The study has been conducted since the early 1980s and is repeated every 9 years. Aside from a series of questions
concerning value orientation, socio-economic data are also collected. On the topic
of **‚ÄúIt is often said that attitudes towards gender roles are changing‚Äù**, the respondents
were presented with a series of statements. They could respond to each statement
with ‚ÄúAgree strongly‚Äù, ‚ÄúAgree‚Äù, ‚ÄúDisagree‚Äù, ‚ÄúDisagree strongly‚Äù and ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt know‚Äù.
The look of the Ô¨Ågure almost matches the previous example. However, there are
a few differences.

- The Ô¨Årst difference lies in the data: while before the diagram was deÔ¨Åned by the individual attributes of a variable, here **several variables are combined**: each bar shows a variable‚Äôs value. Such a group of questions on one
  topic usually means longer labels for the bars, since one wants to show individual
  statements.
- The message of the thematic cluster acts perfectly as the title, while
  **the subtitle shows the selections that were chosen from the answers**. In the current
  example, these are the percent values of the Ô¨Årst two categories ‚Äúagree strongly‚Äù and ‚Äúagree‚Äù. Aside from the repetition of the complete statements that the respondents
  agreed to, given the extensive labels, it is in this case also useful to write the
  percent value in the bars. As in the previous examples, the bars are also again
  complemented by alternating blue areas. For illustration purposes, one question is
  once more especially highlighted.

## Load data

Data source comes from this [link](https://search.gesis.org/research_data/ZA4753). Unfortunately, the data for this study are not directly downloadable, we need make a request via email. So basically I started feeling some disadvantage of this book.

Because the structure of data is quite simple, I tried to recreate it

```r
#Create data

gender_role <- data.frame(Resno = seq(1,7,1),
                          Response = c("A working mother can establish just as warm and\nsecure an environment as a non-working mother",
                                     "A pre-school child is likely to suffer if\nhis or her mother is working",
                                     "A job is alright, but what most women\nreally want is a home and children",
                                     "Being a housewife is just as fulfilling as\nworking",
                                     "Having a job is the best way for a woman\nto be independent",
                                     "Both the husband and wife should contribute\nto the family income",
                                     "In general, fathers are as well suited to\nlook after their children as women"),
                          Percent = c(76.4, 47.2, 33.1, 35.0, 84.8, 84.7, 70.1))
gender_role

## Bonus part

**TIL1**: How to _control_ the custom `scale_color_manual` if we have multiple aesthetic color in different layers

```r
#My pop-up question about using scale_color_manual for different layers with different mapping
#The key idea is using the same "name" and labels if we want to combine them
#https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12410908/combine-legends-for-color-and-shape-into-a-single-legend

#Case 1: If we want the classification has the same color, both in layer text and point
ggplot(gender_role, aes(x=Percent, y=Response)) +
    geom_text(aes(x=10, label=Percent, color=ifelse(Resno == 5, "HL", "NM")), show.legend = F) +
    geom_point(aes(color=ifelse(Resno == 2, "HL", "NM")), size=5, show.legend = F) +
    scale_color_manual(values=c("HL" = "darkblue", "NM" = "red"))

```

![png](/assets/02-Bar-chart-multi/output_13_0.png)

```r
#Case 2: If we want the classification has the different color of "highlight" only in layer geom_point
#The normal element has the same color in both layers

ggplot(gender_role, aes(x=Percent, y=Response)) +
    geom_text(aes(x=10, label=Percent, color=ifelse(Resno == 5, "HL", "NM")), show.legend = F) +
    geom_point(aes(color=ifelse(Resno == 2, "HL2", "NM")), size=5, show.legend = F) +
    scale_color_manual(values=c("HL" = "darkblue", "NM" = "red", "HL2" = "green"))
```

![png](/assets/02-Bar-chart-multi/output_14_0.png)

**TIL2**: adjusting the position of title to the left of plot, not panel.

Because there are many case that the label of y-axis is very long text and it make the plot title look disproportionate.

```
plot.title.position, plot.caption.position

Alignment of the plot title/subtitle and caption. The setting for plot.title.position applies to both the title and the subtitle. A value of "panel" (the default) means that titles and/or caption are aligned to the plot panels. A value of "plot" means that titles and/or caption are aligned to the entire plot (minus any space for margins and plot tag).
```
